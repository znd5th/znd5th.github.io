<h1>Privacy Policy – Yatsy for me</h1>
<p>Last updated: 3 February 2026</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Yatsy for me is a dice game that runs on the user’s device. The app uses Apple’s cloud services to synchronize high scores and settings between your own devices but does not collect personal data for external use by the developer or third parties.</p>
<p>Data Collection</p>
<p>The app does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data with the developer or any third-party companies.</p>
<p>•	No analytics services are used</p>
<p>•	No third-party SDKs are included</p>
<p>•	No user accounts are required</p>
<p>•	No advertising or tracking is implemented</p>
<h2>Data Storage and Synchronization</h2>

<p>•	User preferences (e.g., sorting settings)</p>
<h2>How it is stored:</h2>
<p>1	Local Storage: Data is stored locally on the device using UserDefaults.</p>
<p>2	iCloud Synchronization: To provide a seamless experience, these data points are synchronized between your devices using Apple’s iCloud Key-Value Store.</p>
