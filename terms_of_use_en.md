# Terms of Use

**Yatsy for me** is a simple entertainment application intended for personal use only.

## Application Functionality and Data Storage

The application stores only a **Top-10 score list**, which:

* is saved to the user’s own iCloud account using Apple’s key–value storage
* is synchronized across devices using the same iCloud account
* does not contain personal data or personally identifiable information

The Top-10 score list can be **reset at any time using a button in the application’s user interface**.
All application data is also removed when the application is deleted from the device.

The developer does not have access to the user’s iCloud account or to any data stored by the application.

## No User Accounts or Data Collection

The application does not include user accounts and does not collect, process, or store personal data, analytics data, or tracking information.

Any crash or error reports are handled by Apple according to the user’s device settings. The developer does not receive personally identifiable information from such reports.

## Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

The application is provided **“as is”**, without warranties of any kind, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, reliability, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

The developer shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages, data loss, or other consequences resulting from the use of, or inability to use, the application.

The user is solely responsible for managing their device, iCloud account, and any backups.

## Changes to These Terms

These Terms of Use may be updated if necessary. The current version is available in connection with the application.
